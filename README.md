```
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```

Then browse to localhost:8888


## Disable cache in chrome

Open developer pane (ctrl+shift+j)

In order to find this I had to scroll down about a page past 3 other groups to Network, then Disable Cache is the third option down.

Only works while developer pane is open?
